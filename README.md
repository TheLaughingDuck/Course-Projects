Laboration_1_Stok<br>
This report deals with the long-term transition probabilities of a Markov chain.

Laboration_2_Stok<br>
This report deals with a gamblers-ruin type Markov chain, as well as it's comparison to a slightly different strategy.

Laboration_3_Stok<br>
This report deals with an M|M|1-queue process, primarily through simulation. A formal mathematical approach is also discussed. Specifically, the report focuses on a problem of minimizing the portion of time a computers queue of tasks is full. This is done for three different arrival rates. Discussion about alternative solutions.
